The Real-Time Chat Application is a modern, interactive web application built using React for the frontend and Socket.IO for real-time communication. This application allows users to engage in instant messaging, supporting group chats and real-time typing indicators to enhance the chatting experience. The app is designed to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly, providing an immersive chat environment similar to popular messaging platforms.

## Features

** Real-Time Messaging: Messages are instantly delivered to all participants in a chat room without page reloads. The app uses Socket.IO to establish a persistent WebSocket connection for seamless communication.

** User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is built using React, offering a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface. Users can easily navigate between chat rooms, view messages, and send new ones.

** Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
